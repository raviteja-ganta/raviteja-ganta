title: Sentiment Analysis using BERT and hugging face
---

This article talks about how can we use pretrained language model BERT to do transfer learning on most famous task in NLP - Sentiment Analysis 

Transfer learning is very popular in deep learning but mostly confined to computer vision. Transfer learning in NLP is not very popular until recently(thanks to pretrained
language models). But this usage went up so fast starting 2018 after paper on BERT was released. BERT stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. We can think of this as a language models which looks at both left and right context when prediciting current word. This is what they called masked language modelling(MLM). Additionally BERT also use 'next sentence prediction' task in addition to MLM during pretraining. We can use this pretrained BERT model for transfer learning on downstream tasks like our Sentiment Analysis.

Sentiment Analysis is very popular application in NLP where goal is to find/classify emotions in subjective data. For example given a restaurent review by customer, using sentiment analysis we can understand what customer thinks of the restaurent(whether he likes or not). Before the rise of transfer learning in NLP, RNN's like LSTM's/GRU's are widely used for sentiment analysis to build from scratch. These gave decent results, but what if we can use pretrained unsurpervised models which already have lot of information on how language is structrued(because they were pretrained on massive unlabelled data) for our use case just by adding one additional layer on top of it and just fine tune total model for the task at hand. BERT showed that if we do it this way, we can save lot of time and also get state of art results even with smaller training data.

Below we can see how finetuning is done

Input traning sentence is passed through pretrained BERT model and on top of BERT we add one layer of Feed forward NN with softmax for our sentiment classification. Final hidden state corresponding to [CLS] token is used as the aggregate sequence representation for classification. According to paper, final hidden state is of 768 dimensions but for illustration I used 4 dimensions. Entire model end to end is fine tuned with objective of reducing loss for this first hidden state after softmax.

For this project, I used smaller vesion of BERT called DistillBERT. Huggingface leveraged knowledge distillation during pretraning phase and reduced size of BERT by 40% while retaining 97% of its language understanding capabilities and being 60% faster. 

I tested with both base BERT(BERT has two versions BERT base and BERT large) and DistillBERT and found that peformance dip is not that great when using DistillBERT but training time decreased by 50%.

### 1) Load and preprocess IMDB dataset

```python
# Install huggingface transformers
!pip install -qq transformers

RANDOM_SEED = 42
np.random.seed(RANDOM_SEED)

device = torch.device("cuda:0" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
```

```python
path = "/content/drive/My Drive/IMDB Dataset/IMDB Dataset.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(path)
df.head()
```

```python
##### Do we have class imbalance? Lets see
sns.countplot(df.sentiment)
plt.xlabel('sentiment');
```

</p>

We can see we dont have any imbalance which is perfect. We can safely use accuracy as our metric.

```python
# Create the function to preprocess every tweet
def process_review(review):
  """Process tweet function.
  Input:
      tweet: a string containing a tweet
  Output:
      tweets_clean: a list of words containing the processed tweet

  """
  # remove old style retweet text "RT"
  review = re.sub(r'^RT[\s]+', '', review)
  # remove hyperlinks
  review = re.sub(r'https?:\/\/.*[\r\n]*', '', review)
  review = re.sub(r'#', '', review)
  # removing hyphens
  review = re.sub('-', ' ', review)
  # remove linebreaks
  review = re.sub('<br\s?\/>|<br>', "", review)
  # remving numbers
  review = re.sub(r"(\b|\s+\-?|^\-?)(\d+|\d*\.\d+)\b",'',review)

  # tokenize tweets
  tokenizer = TweetTokenizer(preserve_case=True, strip_handles=True,
                              reduce_len=True)
  tweet_tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(review)

  # remove numbers
  tweet_tokens = [i for i in tweet_tokens if not i.isdigit()]

  tweets_clean = []
  for word in tweet_tokens:
    tweets_clean.append(word)

  return ' '.join(tweets_clean)
```

```python
# Lets apply above function to every tweet in df
df['review_processed'] = df['review'].apply(process_review)

# Also lets encode 'sentiment' column. 1 for positive and 0 for negative sentiment
df['sentiment'] = df['sentiment'].map({'positive':1,'negative':0}) 
```

Now lets load our pretrained Distill tokenizer. This is learned during pre-training. It links each word to a number and is based on wordpiece tokenization.
I am using **distilbert-base-uncased** as our model as this gave best validation accuracy on our data
*We need to convert words to numbers as any deep learning model will need its input as numerical value*

```python
PRE_TRAINED_MODEL_NAME = 'distilbert-base-uncased'
# Lets load pre-trained Distill BertTokenizer
tokenizer = DistilBertTokenizer.from_pretrained(PRE_TRAINED_MODEL_NAME)
```
Now we loaded our tokenizer, why not apply on sample text to see what it is doing

```python
# Lets use below text to understand tokenization process
# First I am processing our review using above defined function
sample_text = process_review(df['review_processed'][0])

# Lets apply our BertTokenizer on sample text
tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(sample_text)    # this will convert sentence to list of words
token_ids = tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids(tokens) # this will convert list of words to list of numbers based on tokenizer

print(f'Sentence: {sample_text}')
print(f'Tokens: {tokens}')
print(f'Token IDs: {token_ids}')
```
Below is output of above code snippet

Sentence: One of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just Oz episode you'll be hooked 
Tokens: ['one', 'of', 'the', 'other', 'reviewers', 'has', 'mentioned', 'that', 'after', 'watching', 'just', 'oz', 'episode', 'you', "'", 'll', 'be', 'hooked']
Token IDs: [2028, 1997, 1996, 2060, 15814, 2038, 3855, 2008, 2044, 3666, 2074, 11472, 2792, 2017, 1005,2222, 2022, 13322]

Before applying our tokens, one thing we need to do. BERT has special requirement. It wants input to be in certain format.

For BERT model we need to add Special tokens in to each tweet. Below are the Special tokens

* [SEP] - Marker for ending of a sentence - BERT uses 102
* [CLS] - We must add this token at start of each sentence, so BERT knows we're doing classification - BERT uses 101
* [PAD] - Special token for padding - BERT uses number 0 for this.
* [UNK] - BERT understands tokens that were in the training set. Everything else can be encoded using this unknown token
