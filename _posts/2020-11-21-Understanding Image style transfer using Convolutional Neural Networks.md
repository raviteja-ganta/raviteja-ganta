Main goal of this post is to explain Gatys et al (2016) work on Image style transfer using CNN’s in easier terms.

Code for generating all images in this notebook can be found at https://github.com/raviteja-ganta/Neural-style-transfer-using-CNN

#### Contents:
1) What is Style transfer?
2) Content of an Image
3) Style of an Image
4) Understanding output of CNN’s
5) Cost function
6) Gram matrix
